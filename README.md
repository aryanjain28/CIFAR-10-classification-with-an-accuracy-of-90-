# CIFAR-10 classification.
Convolutional classification model with an accuracy of ~90%.

# Introduction : 

CIFAR is an acronym that stands for the Canadian Institute For Advanced Research. 
The dataset is comprised of 60,000 32Ã—32 pixel color photographs of objects from 10 classes. The class labels and their standard associated integer values are listed below.

    0: airplane
    1: automobile
    2: bird
    3: cat
    4: deer
    5: dog
    6: frog
    7: horse
    8: ship
    9: truck


# Modules Used : 
  
   1. Tkinter for GUI.
   2. Keras for Deep Learning.
   
# Failed/Unsatisfactory models : 

As shown below, these are screenshots of models that gave unsatisfactory results upon training.
Basically, there were two cases that were not favourable : 
    
    1. Accuracy was stuck at ~75%.
    2. After a set of epochs overfitting occured.
    
    
<br>

Case 1 : As you can see below, after around 40 epochs, overfitting occured : <br>

<br><br>

Case 2 : Learnt from  my mistakes above, I tried the following, but in this case the accuracy was stuck at ~80%.<br>
<p align="center"><img width="460" src="/CIFAR-10/testModelsImages/model-999.PNG"></p>
<br>
<p align="center">When I incresed number of epochs, the accuracy further decresed.</p>

<br><br>

Case 3 : Again, as shown below, when I added Kernel Regularization to overcome above scenario, overfitting occured.<br>
<p align="center"><img width="460" src="/CIFAR-10/testModelsImages/model-9991.PNG"></p>

There are few more cases that I tried training upon. But all were failed due to similar reasons.
    

# Best models : 

<br>
<p align='center'> Model 1 : I used Relu activation function and ADAM optimizer with 125 number of epochs </p>
<p align='center'> with decresing Learning rate and voila! I got a stable accuracy of ~90%.</p>

    If you take a closer look at figure above, 
    you will observe an increment in accuracy at epoch 75 as well as at 100.
    This is were I decreased my learning rate.
    This is the model that is used in project.
    
<p align='center'> I tried to increase the accuracy by incresing number of epochs to 175</p> 
<p align='center'> and further decresing Learning rate, but results were not as I expected them to be. </p>

    You can observe after 125 epoch overfitting started to occur.
    
<br><br>
<p align='center'> Model 2 : Here, I used Elu activation function and RMSProp optimizer </p>
<p align='center'> with same 125 number of epochs  with decresing Learning rate.</p>
